# MANUFACTURING-ANALYSIS
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of manufacturing operations data, with a focus on production efficiency, rejection patterns, and process optimization. The project combines detailed transactional data with key performance indicators (KPIs) to uncover actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.
## Project insights
+ Track total Manufactured Quantity over time.
+ Monitor Rejected Quantity to identify quality issues.
+ Measure Processed Quantity as a key production metric.
+ Calculate and track Wastage Quantity to reduce waste.
+ Analyze Employee-wise Rejected Quantity to find training or process gaps.
+ Review Machine-wise Rejected Quantity to detect equipment-related problems.
+ Observe Production Comparison Trend to see how production performance changes over time.
+ Analyze Department-wise Manufacture vs. Rejected Quantity to identify departmental efficiency.
+ Compare Manufacture vs. Rejected Quantity to monitor rejection rate
## Tools used
+ Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis
+ SQL – Data querying and aggregation to extract meaningful insights
+ Power BI – Building interactive dashboards and KPIs
+ Tableau – Advanced data visualization and trend analysis
